## Project Description
This project analyzes stock prices and price performance for Uber, Lyft, and NASDAQ using R. It includes descriptive statistics, risk metrics (volatility, skewness, kurtosis), correlation matrices, and visualizations. The goal is to assess performance, volatility, and market relationships through data-driven insights.

## Objectives
Evaluate stock price evolution for Uber, Lyft, and NASDAQ
Measure daily performance (returns)
Assess risk using standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis
Explore inter-company and market correlations
Visualize trends and anomalies using boxplots, histograms, and correlation plots

## Tools & Technologies
R: Main programming language
Tidyverse: Data manipulation
moments: Skewness & kurtosis
corrplot: Correlation visualization
Base R: For plotting and calculations
